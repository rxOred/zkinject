### zkinject

zkinject or libzkinject is a C++ library, provides a rich interface to work with elf binaries, proc file system and ptrace system call.
It also provides APIs to write elf infectors and hooks. It abstracts out complexity of elf infection techniques, therefor zkinject is a great resource for anyone interest in malware/ malware analysis and reverse engineering.

Currently it provides (some are incomplete) APIs for Silvio text padding injection and userland hooks

This project is still in the early stages of development :)

Future plans
- Interface to work with ptrace syscall
- Data segment infections
- Reverse text padding infection
- Process image reconstruction
- PT_NOTE infection

when will this thing be completed? it totally depends on 'when will i finish my homework/assignments'.
